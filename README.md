# 🧠 Chat with Multiple PDFs using LLMs (Groq + LangChain + FAISS + Streamlit)

This Streamlit app allows you to chat with the content of multiple PDF documents using a Groq-hosted LLM (like LLaMA 3). It uses LangChain for pipeline orchestration, FAISS for semantic search, and HuggingFace sentence transformers for embeddings.

## 🚀 Features
- 📄 Upload multiple PDF documents
- 🔍 Ask questions based on their content
- 💬 Get detailed, context-aware answers using Groq LLaMA-3
- 🧠 Uses FAISS for fast similarity search
